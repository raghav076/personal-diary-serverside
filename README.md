## Main Highlights

- Something in our daily life happens, which we want to save or write it somewhere. I have created a server-side app in which you can write and save your personal notes anytime anywhere by simply logging in.
- You have to first signup to the app and then you can add new note and you can access all your saved notes anytime.
- This app has been created using NodeJs framework
- This app have few APIs like '/signin', '/signup', '/addNewNote', '/getAllNotes'
